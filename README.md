# Tensorflow_introduction
Welcome to the fifth and final (required) assignment of Course 2 of the Deep Learning Specialization! In this notebook, you'll explore TensorFlow, a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks more easily, and use it to build a neural network and train it on a TensorFlow dataset.
